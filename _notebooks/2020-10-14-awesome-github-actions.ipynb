    "Just weeks ago, I set up this blog with Jekyll on Github Pages. However, I switched to [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) because of Jupyter Notebook support. The swithcing isn't that difficult, but something caught my attention during the process, and that is [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). We have talked about the idea that only pushing source files to the github repo and let Github Pages generate static files by its own. But Github Pages only supports Jekyll and limited number of plugins, and that is where Github Actions can help."

    "Basically, Github Actions is like a remote server that can execute some predifined commands. To use Github Actions to deploy our Github Pages, we still need to generate static files in our repo, but the generation can be done automatically by Github Actions, and generated files can be hosted in another branch other than master. Therefore, we can host all source files in the master branch, and every time we push commits to the master branch (e.g. new posts or modification of layouts), the predifined Github Actions workflow is triggered and it will automatically generate all necessary static files in another branch. We just need to change the repo's setting that decides which branch Github Pages site is built from."

The following action `actions/cache@v2` is to fetch all cached dependencies using `key`, or create the cache of all dependencies if the cache does not exist, so that the workflow does not need to download all dependencies again next time. In Linux, `npm` downloads all packages to `~/.npm`, which is the folder we need to cache. The `key` of the cache is named after the OS and the hashing result of `package-lock.json`, which is reasonable since these two will decide the packages that npm downloads."
