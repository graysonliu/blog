    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I've been practicing on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com). In problem [373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/), I implemented a solution inspired by discussions in the community using `heapq.merge` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of `heapq.merge` is like a multi-way merge sort on many already-sorted iterables. The difference is that `heapq.merge` uses a heap for ordering. Heap is just a binary tree in Python, and it is implemented with an array. `heapq.merge` initially collects the first element of each input iterable to form a list, then it `heapify` the list, transforming it to a heap. The first element of heapâ€”`h[0]`, is always the smallest in the heap (supposing it is a min-heap). `heap.merge` just `pop` `h[0]` and puts it into the result iterator, and then `push` the following element of `h[0]` from the same input iterable into the heap (more details at [source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/heapq.py#L314)). We can also use heap as a priority queue.\n",
